The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, announced at CES 2025, is priced at $1,999 and is scheduled for release on January 30, 2025. 

To build a system that supports the RTX 5090, consider the following components:

- **CPU:** A high-performance processor, such as the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, is recommended to prevent bottlenecks and ensure optimal performance.

- **Memory:** A minimum of 32GB DDR5 RAM is advisable to handle intensive tasks effectively.

- **Motherboard:** A motherboard compatible with PCIe 5.0 x16 slots is necessary to accommodate the RTX 5090.

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** A robust PSU is essential. While specific wattage recommendations for the RTX 5090 are pending, a PSU of at least 1000W is generally recommended for high-end GPUs. 

- **Cooling System:** Adequate cooling solutions, including high-quality CPU coolers and efficient case fans, are crucial to maintain optimal temperatures during operation.

- **Chassis:** A spacious computer case that supports the dimensions of the RTX 5090 (approximately 304mm in length) is necessary. 

**Estimated Cost Breakdown:**

- **GPU (RTX 5090):** $1,999

- **CPU (e.g., AMD Ryzen 9 9950X):** Approximately $700

- **Memory (32GB DDR5 RAM):** Approximately $150

- **Motherboard (PCIe 5.0 compatible):** Approximately $300

- **PSU (1000W or higher):** Approximately $200

- **Cooling System:** Approximately $150

- **Chassis:** Approximately $150

**Total Estimated Cost:** Approximately $3,649

*Note:* Prices are estimates and may vary based on brand choices, availability, and regional differences.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Compatibility:** Ensure all components are compatible with each other to avoid potential issues during assembly.

- **Future-Proofing:** Investing in higher specifications may provide better longevity and performance for future applications.
