No, you cannot directly copy the `Jetson_Linux_R36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2` file to an SD card using Etcher because it's not a bootable image. Instead, you need to follow the appropriate procedure to flash your Jetson device or create a bootable SD card.

Hereâ€™s how to proceed:

---

### **Create a Bootable SD Card**
1. **Extract the Archive:**
   - Extract the `Jetson_Linux_R36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2` file on your Linux PC:
     ```bash
     tar -xvf Jetson_Linux_R36.4.3_aarch64.tbz2
     ```
   - This will create a directory, usually named `Linux_for_Tegra/`.

2. **Insert the SD Card:**
   - Insert your SD card into your Linux PC and identify its device name (e.g., `/dev/sdX`) using:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```

3. **Prepare the SD Card Image:**
   - Navigate to the `Linux_for_Tegra/tools` directory:
     ```bash
     cd Linux_for_Tegra/tools
     ```
   - Use the `create-jetson-nano-sd-card-image.sh` script to create an SD card image. For example:
     ```bash
     ./create-jetson-nano-sd-card-image.sh -o jetson_sd.img -s 64G
     ```
     Replace `64G` with the size of your SD card if different.

4. **Flash the SD Card:**
   - Use a tool like `dd` or `Etcher` to flash the generated `.img` file (`jetson_sd.img`) to the SD card:
     - **Using `dd`:**
       ```bash
       sudo dd if=jetson_sd.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
       ```
       Replace `/dev/sdX` with your SD card's device name.
     - **Using Etcher:**
       - Open Etcher, select the `.img` file, and choose your SD card as the target. Then flash it.

5. **Boot from SD Card:**
   - Insert the SD card into your Jetson device.
   - Power it on. The device should boot from the SD card.

### **Flash Internal eMMC Using the File**
If your Jetson device uses eMMC storage (e.g., Xavier, Orin modules):
1. Put the Jetson device into recovery mode:
   - Power off the Jetson.
   - Hold the **recovery button** while powering it on.
   - Connect the device to your Linux PC via USB.

2. On your Linux PC:
   - Navigate to the extracted `Linux_for_Tegra/` directory.
   - Flash the device using the `flash.sh` script:
     ```bash
     sudo ./flash.sh jetson-agx-xavier-devkit mmcblk0p1
     ```
     Replace `jetson-agx-xavier-devkit` with the appropriate configuration for your device.

3. Wait for the process to complete. Once done, reboot your Jetson.

### **Additional Notes**
- Ensure you use the correct version of the L4T (Linux for Tegra) files compatible with your Jetson hardware.
- Back up any important data before flashing or creating the SD card, as the process can overwrite existing files.
