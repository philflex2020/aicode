**Proposal: Data Compression and Key Mapping for Analytics**
**1. Introduction:**
The Analytics team faces challenges in handling large volumes of data efficiently and standardizing component naming across different sites. To address these issues, here is a suggested extension to the existing FIMS_CODEC system, which will provide data compression and key mapping capabilities. This proposal outlines the benefits and implementation of the suggested approach.
**2. Problem Statement:**
*Problem 1: Handling Masses of Data*
The Analytics team deals with vast amounts of JSON data, which can be resource-intensive to store and process. Efficient data compression techniques are required to reduce storage requirements and improve processing speed.
*Problem 2: Component Naming Consistency*
Different sites may use different naming conventions for components, leading to confusion and difficulty in analyzing data across sites. A solution is needed to map component names to a common set of keys, facilitating data standardization and analysis.
**3. Proposed Solution: Data Compression and Key Mapping**
**3.1 Data Compression**
The proposed solution involves compressing the raw FIMS data in the form of JSON objects. Instead of storing all the JSON keys in the data, we will replace them with unique IDs and represent the values in binary form (excluding strings). A separate key file will store the mapping of IDs to original keys.
**3.2 Key Mapping**
To address the issue of component naming consistency, the key file can be modified to map original component names to a common set of keys. This key mapping will allow easy conversion of data between different naming conventions, making it easier to analyze and compare data from various sites.
**4. Implementation:**
**4.1 Data Compression and Decoding**
The FIMS_CODEC system will be extended to include data compression and decoding functionality. The encoding process will replace JSON keys with unique IDs and store values in binary form, while the decoding process will extract the keys from the key file and recreate the original JSON objects.
**4.2 Key Mapping**
A mechanism will be introduced to modify the key file, allowing users to map component names to common keys. This mapping can be easily adjusted as needed, providing flexibility in handling data from diverse sources.
**5. Benefits:**
- Significant Reduction in Data Size: The proposed data compression technique is expected to achieve a compression ratio of around 5:1, resulting in a substantial reduction in data storage requirements.
- Faster Processing: Compressed data will be quicker to process, improving data analysis and generating insights more efficiently.
- Component Naming Consistency: Key mapping will standardize component names, enabling easier data comparison and analysis across different sites.
**6. Conclusion:**
The proposed extension to the FIMS_CODEC system will enhance the Analytics team's data handling capabilities significantly. By employing data compression and key mapping techniques, the team can efficiently manage large volumes of data while ensuring consistency in component naming. This will lead to faster and more effective data analysis, ultimately contributing to improved decision-making and insights for the organization.
