Certainly! If you're looking to run WebAssembly in Python, you can utilize the `wasmer` library, which provides bindings to execute WebAssembly code.

First, you'll need to install the `wasmer` library, which you can do using pip:

```bash
pip install wasmer
```

Here's a simple demo that defines a WebAssembly module, compiles it, and then runs it from Python using the Wasmer library.

```python
from wasmer import engine, Store, Module, Instance

# Let's define the store, that holds the engine, that holds the compiler.
store = Store(engine.JIT)  # Feel free to use engine.Native to have AOT.

# Let's write the WebAssembly module as bytes for the sake of the example.
wasm_bytes = (
    b"\x00\x61\x73\x6d\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01\x07\x01\x60\x02\x7f\x7f\x01\x7f\x03\x02\x01\x00\x07\x07\x01\x03\x61\x64\x64\x00\x00\x0a\x09\x01\x07\x00\x20\x00\x20\x01\x6a\x0b"
)

# Let's compile the WebAssembly module.
module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)

# Let's instantiate the WebAssembly module.
instance = Instance(module)

# Let's call the `add` exported function with 5 and 37 as arguments.
result = instance.exports.add(5, 37)

print(result)  # 42!
```

This example loads a pre-compiled WebAssembly module that exports an `add` function. This function simply adds two integers together and returns the result.

Make sure you have the Wasmer runtime installed in your environment, as this code will not run without it. You can find further details and documentation on the [Wasmer Python API documentation page](https://docs.wasmer.io/wasmer-python/api/wasmer.html).
