Certainly! Here's the directory structure you laid out based on our discussion:

```
test/
|-- test.json 
|-- topics/
    |-- topic1/
        |-- desc.json
        |-- actions.json
        |-- steps/
            |-- step1/
                |-- desc.json
                |-- actions.json
            |-- step2/
                |-- desc.json
                |-- actions.json
    |-- topic2/
        |-- desc.json
        |-- actions.json
        |-- steps/
            |-- step1/
                |-- desc.json
                |-- actions.json
            |-- step2/
                |-- desc.json
                |-- actions.json
    // ... potentially more topics and steps
```

- **test.json** describes the main test.
- Inside each topic directory, there's:
    - **desc.json**: Describes the topic.
    - **actions.json**: Contains actions related to the topic.
    - A **steps/** directory that contains individual step directories.
        - Inside each step directory:
            - **desc.json**: Describes the step.
            - **actions.json**: Contains actions related to the step. 

I hope this layout reflects the structure you had in mind. If there are any adjustments to make, please let me know!
