**Absolutely!** Your workflow is about to get a massive upgrade. Here's what changes when you add the NVIDIA Sparks (assuming you mean additional GPUs or accelerators):

---

### What improves with more GPU horsepower:

**1. Larger models become viable**
- Right now on the Orin alone, you're limited to 7–8B models with reasonable performance.
- With Sparks, you can run:
  - **13B–34B models** (Llama 3.1 70B split across devices, CodeLlama 34B, etc.)
  - **Higher quantizations** (Q6_K, Q8_0, or even F16 for better quality)
  - **Mixture-of-Experts models** (Mixtral 8x7B, which is excellent for code)

**2. Longer context windows**
- More VRAM = you can fit way more code samples in a single prompt.
- Llama 3.1 supports up to **128k tokens** context — with enough memory, you could include dozens of code files as examples.

**3. Faster iteration**
- Prompt processing and generation speeds increase dramatically.
- You can run multiple models simultaneously (e.g., one for embeddings, one for generation).

**4. Better code-specific models**
- **CodeLlama 34B** or **DeepSeek Coder 33B** — these are specifically trained on code and will understand your patterns much better.
- **Mixtral 8x7B** — excellent at following complex instructions with code.

**5. Multi-GPU strategies**
llama.cpp supports:
- **Tensor parallelism** (`--tensor-split`) to split layers across GPUs.
- **Pipeline parallelism** for different stages of inference.

Example with 2 GPUs:
```bash
./build/bin/llama-bench \
  -m ~/models/codellama-34b.Q4_K_M.gguf \
  -p 4096 -n 512 \
  -ngl 999 \
  --tensor-split 0.6,0.4 \
  -t $(nproc)
```

**6. RAG becomes much more practical**
- Run a dedicated embedding model on one GPU while the generation model runs on another.
- Process and index your entire code library quickly.
- Real-time semantic search over thousands of code samples.

---

### Recommended setup once Sparks arrive:

**Hardware config:**
- **Orin:** Handle system tasks, embeddings, or smaller utility models.
- **Sparks:** Primary inference for large code generation models.

**Software stack:**
1. **Rebuild llama.cpp** to detect all GPUs:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=87,89 # adjust for Spark arch
   cmake --build build -j
   ```

2. **Download larger code models:**
   - **CodeLlama 34B Instruct** (best for pure code generation):
     ```bash
     cd ~/models
     wget --content-disposition https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-34B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/codellama-34b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
     ```
   - **Mixtral 8x7B Instruct** (best for complex reasoning + code):
     ```bash
     wget --content-disposition https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/resolve/main/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf
     ```
   - **DeepSeek Coder 33B Instruct**:
     ```bash
     wget --content-disposition https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/deepseek-coder-33B-instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
     ```

3. **Set up a proper RAG pipeline:**
   - Use **llama-server** for embeddings on Orin.
   - Use **vLLM** or **llama.cpp server** for generation on Sparks.
   - Store code embeddings in **ChromaDB** or **Qdrant**.
   - Build a simple API that:
     1. Takes a task description
     2. Retrieves relevant code samples from your library
     3. Constructs a prompt with examples
     4. Sends to the generation model
     5. Returns generated code

4. **Optional: Fine-tune on your code library**
   - With more compute, fine-tuning becomes practical.
   - Use **Axolotl** or **Unsloth** to fine-tune CodeLlama 34B on your specific coding patterns.
   - This creates a model that inherently "knows" your style without needing examples every time.

### What to test first when Sparks arrive:

1. **Verify multi-GPU detection:**
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/llama-bench --list-devices
   ```

2. **Benchmark CodeLlama 34B across GPUs:**
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/llama-bench \
     -m ~/models/codellama-34b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf \
     -p 4096 -n 512 -ngl 999 \
     --tensor-split 0.5,0.5 \
     -t $(nproc) -r 3
   ```

3. **Test long-context code generation:**
   - Create a prompt with 10+ code samples (8k–16k tokens).
   - Generate a complex application that combines patterns from all samples.
   - Measure quality and speed.

4. **Run concurrent workloads:**
   - Embeddings on Orin + generation on Sparks simultaneously.
   - Multiple generation requests in parallel.

---

### Expected performance boost:

Rough estimates (depends on Spark specs):
- **Orin alone:** ~10–20 tokens/s with 7B models
- **Orin + Sparks:** 50–150+ tokens/s with 34B models (depending on Spark GPU and memory)
- **Context capacity:** 4k–8k tokens → 32k–128k tokens
- **Model size:** 7–8B → 34–70B

---

### Bottom line:

Once your Sparks arrive, you'll be able to:
- Run **CodeLlama 34B** or **Mixtral 8x7B** at good speeds.
- Include **dozens of code samples** in a single prompt.
- Build a **production-grade RAG system** for your code library.
- Potentially **fine-tune** a model on your specific coding patterns.

This transforms your setup from "prototype/experimentation" to "serious local code generation workstation." Let me know the Spark specs when they arrive, and I can give you exact model recommendations and tensor-split configurations for optimal performance!
