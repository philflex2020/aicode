**Short answer:** Yes, all three can do this to varying degrees, but they'll work best with careful prompting and context management. None of them natively maintain a persistent "library" across sessions, but you can build that functionality around them.

---

### How they handle code generation with examples:

**1. Mistral 7B Instruct**
- **Code capability:** Good at code generation, especially with clear instructions and examples.
- **Few-shot learning:** You can provide 1–3 code samples in your prompt, and it will learn the pattern and generate similar code.
- **Limitations:** 7B models have limited context windows (typically 4k–8k tokens), so you can only fit a few examples per prompt.

**2. Llama 2 7B (base)**
- **Code capability:** Decent at code completion but not specifically trained for instruction following.
- **Few-shot learning:** Works, but requires more careful prompt engineering since it's not instruction-tuned.
- **Limitations:** Less reliable for complex code generation tasks without fine-tuning.

**3. Llama 3.1 8B Instruct**
- **Code capability:** Strong code generation and understanding, better than Llama 2 and competitive with Mistral for many tasks.
- **Few-shot learning:** Excellent at learning from examples in-context.
- **Context window:** Llama 3.1 supports much longer contexts (up to 128k tokens in some versions), so you can include many more code samples.
- **Best choice for your use case.**

### Building a code library system:

Since these models don't persist memory between sessions, you'll need to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system:

**Architecture:**
1. **Store code samples** in a vector database or simple file structure with embeddings.
2. **Retrieve relevant samples** based on the user's request (semantic search).
3. **Inject samples into the prompt** as context for the LLM.
4. **Generate new code** based on the examples and instructions.

**Simple implementation approach:**

```bash
# 1. Store your code samples in a directory structure
~/code_library/
  ├── auth/
  │   ├── jwt_auth.py
  │   └── oauth_flow.cpp
  ├── database/
  │   ├── postgres_connection.py
  │   └── redis_cache.cpp
  └── websocket/
      └── uwebsockets_server.cpp

# 2. Use llama.cpp with a prompt template that includes examples
```

**Example prompt pattern:**
```
You are a code generation assistant. Below are examples from my code library:

--- Example 1: WebSocket Server (uWebSockets) ---
[paste your uwebsockets_server.cpp here]

--- Example 2: JWT Authentication ---
[paste your jwt_auth.py here]

--- Task ---
Generate a new WebSocket server in C++ that uses JWT authentication for client connections, following the patterns shown above.

--- Generated Code ---
```

**Tools to make this easier:**

1. **llama-server with embeddings** (built into llama.cpp):
   - Start the server with embedding mode:
   ```bash
   ./build/bin/llama-server -m ~/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf --embedding --port 8080
   ```
   - Use the `/embedding` endpoint to create vector representations of your code samples.
   - Store embeddings in a simple vector DB (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, or even SQLite with vector extensions).

2. **Simple Python wrapper** to manage the library:
   ```python
   # Pseudocode
   def generate_code_with_examples(task_description):
       # 1. Search your code library for relevant examples
       relevant_samples = search_code_library(task_description)
       
       # 2. Build prompt with examples
       prompt = build_prompt(task_description, relevant_samples)
       
       # 3. Send to llama.cpp server
       response = requests.post('http://localhost:8080/completion', 
                                json={'prompt': prompt, 'n_predict': 512})
       
       return response.json()['content']
   ```

3. **Use llama.cpp's context management:**
   - For interactive sessions, you can maintain context across multiple requests by using the `/completion` endpoint with `cache_prompt: true` to avoid re-processing examples every time.

### Recommended approach for your Jetson:

**Option A: Simple file-based system (no RAG)**
- Keep your code samples in organized files.
- Manually select 2–5 relevant examples for each generation task.
- Paste them into the prompt with your instruction.
- Use **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** for best results.

**Option B: RAG system with embeddings**
- Use llama-server in embedding mode to vectorize your code samples.
- Store embeddings in ChromaDB or a simple vector store.
- When generating code, retrieve the top 3–5 most relevant samples and inject them into the prompt.
- This scales better as your library grows.

**Option C: Fine-tune a model on your code library**
- If you have 100+ high-quality code samples, you can fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B on your specific coding patterns.
- This creates a model that "knows" your style without needing examples in every prompt.
- Tools: Axolotl, LLaMA-Factory, or Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning on Jetson.

### Quick test to see if this works for you:

1. Download **Llama 3.1 8B Instruct** (best for code + long context).
2. Create a prompt with 2–3 of your existing code samples.
3. Ask it to generate a new application combining patterns from those samples.

Example:
```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli \
  -m ~/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf \
  -f my_code_prompt.txt \
  --n-predict 512 \
  --n-gpu-layers 999 \
  --ctx-size 8192
```

Where `my_code_prompt.txt` contains:
```
You are an expert C++ developer. Below are two code samples from my library:

[Sample 1: Your WebSocket server code]
[Sample 2: Your SSL/TLS setup code]

Task: Generate a new WebSocket server that combines these patterns and adds support for client certificate verification.
```

If this works well, you can automate the retrieval and prompt construction with a simple script or RAG system.

**Bottom line:** Llama 3.1 8B Instruct is your best bet for this use case, and you'll want to build a simple retrieval system (even just file-based search) to manage your growing code library.
