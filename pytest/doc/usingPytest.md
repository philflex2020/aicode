write a python script to find the average value of a list on numbers.
write a pytest script to test the resultis within a defined range of values

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an updated version of the Python script to find the average value of a list of numbers, and a pytest script to test if the result is within a defined range of values:


Dont forget these.

yum install -y python-pip
python3 -m pip install pytest


Python script (average_calculator.py):

python
Copy code
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("The list is empty.")

    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average
pytest script (test_average_calculator.py):

python
Copy code

```python
# assume running form the root dir
import sys
sys.path.append('./src')
import pytest
from average_calculator import calculate_average

def test_calculate_average():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    expected_average = 3

    result = calculate_average(numbers)
    assert result == pytest.approx(expected_average)

def test_calculate_average_empty_list():
    numbers = []

    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        calculate_average(numbers)

def test_calculate_average_within_range():
    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    expected_average = 30
    tolerance = 1e-6

    result = calculate_average(numbers)
    assert result >= expected_average - tolerance
    assert result <= expected_average + tolerance
```

Make sure to save the first script as average_calculator.py and the second script as test_average_calculator.py in the same directory.

To run the pytest script, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
```bash
pytest -v --full-trace test/test_avrage_calcuator.py 
```


Make sure you have the pytest package installed, which you can install using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pytest
The first test, test_calculate_average, checks if the calculated average matches the expected average for a list of numbers using the pytest.approx function, which allows for a small tolerance in the comparison.

The second test, test_calculate_average_empty_list, checks if a ValueError is raised when an empty list is passed to the calculate_average function.

The third test, test_calculate_average_within_range, checks if the calculated average falls within a defined range of values using a tolerance. In this case, the expected average is 30, and the tolerance is set to 1e-6 (a very small value). You can adjust the expected average and tolerance values according to your specific case.
