# Dynamic Function Loader Project Documentation

This project demonstrates how to dynamically load shared objects containing functions with a specific interface and call these functions by name from the main program.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

project_root/
|- func/
| |- multiply_function.cpp
|- include/
| |- MyFunctionInterface.h
|- src/
| |- main.cpp
|- build_share/
|- Makefile

vbnet
Copy code

- `func/`: Contains the source file `multiply_function.cpp`, which defines the function `multiply` that will be loaded as a shared object.

- `include/`: Contains the header file `MyFunctionInterface.h`, which defines the interface for the functions in the shared objects.

- `src/`: Contains the source file `main.cpp`, which is the main program that loads the shared objects and calls functions by name.

- `build_share/`: This directory will be created during compilation and will contain the compiled shared object file and the main program.

- `Makefile`: The Makefile to build the project.

## How the Project Works

1. The `MyFunctionInterface.h` header file defines the interface for the functions that will be loaded from the shared objects. It contains the function signature that all shared objects' functions should adhere to.

2. The `func/multiply_function.cpp` file provides an example of a shared object containing a function called `multiply`. The function takes an integer and a float as arguments and returns their multiplication as an integer.

3. The Makefile defines the compilation rules and creates the `build_share/` directory during the build process. It compiles the `multiply_function.cpp` file into a shared object named `libmultiply_function.so` and the `main.cpp` file into the `main_program`.

4. The `main.cpp` file in the `src/` directory demonstrates how to dynamically load the shared object and call the `multiply` function from it.

5. When the `main_program` is executed, it loads the `libmultiply_function.so` shared object and calls the `multiply` function with the arguments 5 and 3.5. The result of the multiplication is then printed to the console.

## How to Build and Run the Project

1. Ensure you have `g++` and the `dlfcn.h` header available on your system.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

3. To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
make
The shared object libmultiply_function.so and the main_program will be placed in the build_share/ directory.

To run the main program, execute:

bash
Copy code
./build_share/main_program
The program should load the shared object, call the multiply function, and display the result.
Cleaning Up
To clean the project and remove all compiled files, run:

bash
Copy code
make clean
This will remove the build_share/ directory and all compiled object files.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use dynamic loading to load shared objects containing functions with a specific interface. By using function pointer casting and the dlsym function, the main program can call functions from the shared objects by their names, enabling dynamic extension of the program's functionality without the need for recompilation.

Please note that this project is designed for UNIX-like systems and uses dlopen, which may not be available on all platforms. Additionally, be cautious when loading shared objects from untrusted sources, as it can pose security risks. Always verify the integrity of the shared objects before loading them.
