I have a c++ function that has 4 structs as parameters.
I want to have several of these as loadable shared objects
The main program has a map of functions names and pointers ( as void *) .
when asked for a function by name the main will try to load the function called the same name.so and execute the init function inside that object that will register the function by name inside that map.
The main program can then call the function by its string name by looking up the function in the map , recasting the void * into an function pointer and then executing it.

It seems like you want to implement a system where you can load shared objects (.so files) containing functions with a specific interface, and then be able to call these functions by name from the main program. To achieve this, you'll need to use dynamic loading and function pointer casting. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this in C++:

Define the function interface:
First, you need to define the function interface that all the shared objects will adhere to. Let's assume you have a function with the following signature:
cpp
Copy code
typedef int (*MyFunction)(int, float);
This is just an example; you can define the function with the appropriate signature based on your requirements.

Define the initialization function in each shared object:
Each shared object should have an initialization function (e.g., init) that will be called by the main program when the shared object is loaded. This function should register the function in the main program's function map. The initialization function's signature should look something like this:
cpp
Copy code
extern "C" void init(std::map<std::string, void*>& functionMap);
Load the shared object dynamically:
In the main program, when you want to load a shared object, you'll use the dlopen function from the dlfcn.h header. This function will return a handle to the loaded shared object:
cpp
Copy code
#include <dlfcn.h>

void* loadSharedObject(const std::string& filename) {
    void* handle = dlopen(filename.c_str(), RTLD_LAZY);
    if (!handle) {
        std::cerr << "Error loading shared object: " << dlerror() << std::endl;
        return nullptr;
    }
    return handle;
}
Call the initialization function in the shared object:
After loading the shared object, you can call the init function from the loaded shared object to register the function in the main program's map:
cpp
Copy code
void callInitFunction(void* handle, std::map<std::string, void*>& functionMap) {
    typedef void (*InitFunction)(std::map<std::string, void*>&);
    InitFunction initFunc = reinterpret_cast<InitFunction>(dlsym(handle, "init"));
    if (!initFunc) {
        std::cerr << "Error getting the init function: " << dlerror() << std::endl;
        dlclose(handle);
        return;
    }
    initFunc(functionMap);
}
Call the functions from the main program:
To call a function by its string name from the main program, you can use the function map and function pointer casting:
cpp
Copy code
int callFunctionByName(const std::string& functionName, int arg1, float arg2) {
    std::map<std::string, void*>::iterator it = functionMap.find(functionName);
    if (it != functionMap.end()) {
        MyFunction funcPtr = reinterpret_cast<MyFunction>(it->second);
        return funcPtr(arg1, arg2);
    }
    std::cerr << "Function not found: " << functionName << std::endl;
    return -1; // Or handle the error as needed
}
Putting it all together in the main program:
In your main program, you can now load shared objects and call functions by their names:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::map<std::string, void*> functionMap;

    void* handle1 = loadSharedObject("shared_object_1.so");
    if (handle1) {
        callInitFunction(handle1, functionMap);
    }

    void* handle2 = loadSharedObject("shared_object_2.so");
    if (handle2) {
        callInitFunction(handle2, functionMap);
    }

    int result = callFunctionByName("function_name", 42, 3.14);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

    // Don't forget to clean up: close the handles and free the resources
    dlclose(handle1);
    dlclose(handle2);

    return 0;
}
Remember to handle errors and edge cases appropriately in your implementation.

Note: This dynamic loading approach is specific to UNIX-like systems that support the dlfcn.h header. For Windows, you would need to use a different dynamic loading mechanism (e.g., LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress).
