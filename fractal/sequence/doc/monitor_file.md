Below is the shell script to make `bms` a command-line argument, dynamically include it in the log file name, and make the script executable.

### Script: `monitor_journal.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a service name argument is provided
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <service-name> [size-limit-in-kb]"
    exit 1
fi

SERVICE_NAME=$1
SIZE_LIMIT=${2:-500} # Default size limit is 500 KB if not provided
LOG_FILE="/var/log/fractal/journal_${SERVICE_NAME}.log"

# Start journalctl for the specified service and capture its PID
JOURNAL_PID=$(journalctl -u "${SERVICE_NAME}" -ef > "${LOG_FILE}" 2>&1 & echo $!)

# Check if journalctl started successfully
if [ -z "$JOURNAL_PID" ]; then
    echo "Failed to start journalctl for service: ${SERVICE_NAME}"
    exit 1
fi

# Run the Python script to monitor log file size and kill the process if needed
python3 /apps/sbms/bin/killer_pid.py "${LOG_FILE}" "${JOURNAL_PID}" "${SIZE_LIMIT}" &

echo "Monitoring started for service: ${SERVICE_NAME}"
echo "Log file: ${LOG_FILE}"
echo "Journalctl PID: ${JOURNAL_PID}"
```

### Make the Script Executable
Run the following command to make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x monitor_journal.sh
```

### Usage
```bash
./monitor_journal.sh <service-name> [size-limit-in-kb]
```

### Example
```bash
./monitor_journal.sh bms 500
```

### Explanation
1. **Command-Line Arguments**:
   - The `service-name` (`bms` in your example) is provided as the first argument.
   - An optional size limit is provided as the second argument, defaulting to `500 KB`.

2. **Dynamic Log File Name**:
   - The log file is named `journal_<service-name>.log`, where `<service-name>` is replaced by the provided argument.

3. **Process Management**:
   - The `journalctl` process PID is dynamically captured and passed to the `killer_pid.py` script for monitoring.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - The script handles missing arguments and provides meaningful error messages.
