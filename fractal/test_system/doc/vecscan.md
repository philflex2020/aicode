The provided code accomplishes the following:

1. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - Utilizes `wscat` to communicate with a WebSocket server, retrieve data, and parse JSON responses.
   - Extracts the `data` field as a vector of `uint16_t`.

2. **Match Management**:
   - Stores each `InputVector` in a per-run list within `inputVecs`.
   - Manages unique matches using `matchObjects`, each of which tracks a unique vector and associated matches across runs.

3. **Consistency Checks**:
   - Ensures that the `match_id` for each `InputVector` remains consistent across runs.

### Key Improvements and Considerations:

#### 1. **Concurrency with WebSocket Calls**:
   - Current `execute_wscat` implementation runs sequentially. This is fine for small-scale testing but might become a bottleneck.
   - Suggestion:
     - Use a thread pool to run WebSocket calls concurrently.
     - Example: Use `std::async` or a dedicated thread pool library for better scalability.

#### 2. **Error Handling for WebSocket Calls**:
   - Current `execute_wscat` assumes all commands succeed. Add error handling to gracefully handle failures (e.g., network issues).
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     try {
         result = execute_wscat(url, offset, data_size, seq);
     } catch (const std::exception& ex) {
         std::cerr << "Error in WebSocket call: " << ex.what() << "\n";
         continue; // Skip to the next sequence
     }
     ```

#### 3. **Vector Comparison**:
   - Use `std::vector`'s `==` operator for comparison instead of a custom `vectors_equal` function, as it’s already optimized.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (match_object.vector == current_vector.data) { /* ... */ }
     ```

#### 4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - **Avoid Repeated Searches in `matchObjects`**:
     - Use a `std::unordered_map` to map vector hashes to `match_id`. This avoids linear scans of `matchObjects` for each input vector.
   - **Hashing Function**:
     ```cpp
     struct VectorHash {
         std::size_t operator()(const std::vector<uint16_t>& vec) const {
             std::size_t hash = 0;
             for (auto& v : vec) {
                 hash ^= std::hash<uint16_t>()(v) + 0x9e3779b9 + (hash << 6) + (hash >> 2);
             }
             return hash;
         }
     };
     ```
     - Replace `std::vector<MatchObject>` with `std::unordered_map<std::vector<uint16_t>, MatchObject, VectorHash>`.

#### 5. **Scalability and Memory Management**:
   - Store only relevant vectors and matches to reduce memory overhead.
   - Periodically clean up `inputVecs` and `matchObjects` for completed runs or stale data.

### Example Output:
Given the current implementation, the output might look like this:

#### Matches Detected:
```plaintext
Match ID: 1
Vector: 10 20 30 40 
Matched Indices for Run 0: 0 1 

Match ID: 2
Vector: 100 200 300 400 
Matched Indices for Run 0: 2 

Match ID: 3
Vector: 12 21 31 39 
Matched Indices for Run 0: 3 
```

#### Consistency Check:
```plaintext
Checking match consistency for Run 0...
Match consistency check complete.
```

### Further Suggestions:
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test individual functions like `process_matches` and `check_match_consistency` to validate correctness for edge cases.
- **Data Serialization**:
  - Save `inputVecs` and `matchObjects` to disk for persistence and debugging.
- **Interactive Debugging**:
  - Add a `--debug` mode to print detailed internal state (e.g., vector contents, matches).
