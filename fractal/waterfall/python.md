✅ **Yes! You can absolutely use a Python virtual environment (venv) under Windows**—it’s the best way to keep your project clean and isolated.

Here’s how you can do it step by step:

---

## 🏗 **1. Create a Virtual Environment**

Open **Command Prompt** (or PowerShell) in the folder where you want your project, then run:

```cmd
python -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder called `venv` that holds an isolated Python environment.

---

## ▶️ **2. Activate the Environment**

In **Windows Command Prompt**:

```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

In **PowerShell**:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You’ll know it’s active because your prompt will look like:

```
(venv) C:\YourPath>
```

---

## 📦 **3. Install pygame Inside the venv**

While the venv is active, install `pygame`:

```cmd
pip install pygame
```

This keeps `pygame` only inside this project, not system-wide.

---

## 🖥 **4. Run the Landscape Script**

Still in the activated venv, run:

```cmd
python landscape.py
```

The window should pop up and draw the wireframe landscape.

---

## ❌ **5. Deactivate When Done**

Just type:

```cmd
deactivate
```

to leave the virtual environment.

---

### ✅ Why Use a venv?

* Keeps your project **isolated**
* Avoids messing up your **system Python**
* Easy to remove—just delete the `venv` folder

---

Would you like me to:
✅ Give you a **one-time batch file** to automate **activate → install pygame → run**?
✅ Or also add **animated motion** so the landscape “flies” like a moving demo?

✅ **Yes, it will run on Windows with Python** just fine!

`pygame` is **cross-platform**, so the same code works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS** without changes.

---

## 🔧 How to run it on Windows

1. **Install Python** (if you don’t have it already)

   * [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   * During install, check ✅ **“Add Python to PATH”**

2. **Install pygame**
   Open a Command Prompt and run:

   ```cmd
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Save the script**

   * Copy the code I gave into a file named `landscape.py`

4. **Run it**

   ```cmd
   python landscape.py
   ```

5. A **blue wireframe mountain-like landscape** should appear in a window.

   * Close the window normally when done.

---

### ✅ What You’ll See

It will draw a **static wireframe mountain ridge** (same as the original QBASIC version).
If you like, we can add:

* **Animation (flying over the terrain)**
* **Color gradients for depth**
* Or a **rotating viewpoint** to make it more dynamic.

---

Would you like me to:
✅ **Add a simple animation loop** (camera moving)?
✅ Or keep it static like the BASIC version?

Got it! This is a classic **QBASIC landscape/3D ridge demo** that draws a **wireframe heightmap** using perspective-like math and a hidden-surface buffer (`Z()` array). Let’s translate it into **Python** with a graphical library (we’ll use `pygame` for simplicity).

---

## ✅ What the BASIC code does

* Starts at a point `(X2, Y2)`
* Loops over a grid of `X, Y` points
* Computes `D = sqrt((X - X2)^2 + (Y - Y2)^2)` (distance from center)
* Maps `(X, Y)` into screen coordinates:

  * `XNEW = 50 + 14*Y + X*10`
  * `YNEW = 200 - X*4 + Y*4 - 180*cos(D/5)/(D+1)`
* Uses a **hidden-surface buffer** (`Z[N]`) to only draw if this new point is **closer**
* Draws two passes:

  * Forward pass `Y=0→24`
  * Reverse pass `Y=24→0`
* Produces a **shaded mountain ridge effect**

---

## ✅ Python Version (with `pygame`)

```python
import pygame
import math

# Screen setup
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 640, 480
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("QBASIC Landscape in Python")

# Constants
X2, Y2 = 7, 13  # starting point
Z = [WIDTH] * (WIDTH + 1)  # hidden-surface buffer

# Colors
BG_COLOR = (0, 0, 0)
LINE_COLOR = (0, 200, 255)

def draw_landscape():
    global Z
    # First pass: Y from 0 to 24
    for x in range(0, 25):
        for y in range(0, 25):
            t = y
            draw_point(x, y, t)
    # Reset Z buffer
    Z = [WIDTH] * (WIDTH + 1)
    # Second pass: Y from 24 down to 0
    for y in reversed(range(0, 25)):
        for x in range(0, 25):
            t = x
            draw_point(x, y, t)

# State for connecting lines
x_old, y_old = 0, 0

def draw_point(X, Y, T):
    global x_old, y_old

    D = math.sqrt((X - X2) ** 2 + (Y - Y2) ** 2)
    XNEW = 50 + 14 * Y + X * 10
    YNEW = 200 - X * 4 + Y * 4 - 180 * math.cos(D / 5) / (D + 1)

    if T != 0:
        dx = XNEW - x_old
        dy = YNEW - y_old
        if dx == 0:
            return
        YD = dy / dx
        Y4 = y_old
        n_start = int(x_old)
        n_end = int(XNEW)
        if n_start > n_end:  # handle reversed direction
            n_start, n_end = n_end, n_start

        for n in range(n_start, min(n_end, WIDTH-1)):
            if Z[n] <= Y4:
                Y4 += YD
                continue
            pygame.draw.line(screen, LINE_COLOR, (n, Y4), (n, Y4))
            Z[n] = Y4
            Y4 += YD

    x_old = XNEW
    y_old = YNEW

def main():
    running = True
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    screen.fill(BG_COLOR)
    
    draw_landscape()  # draw once

    pygame.display.flip()

    # Wait for quit
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        clock.tick(30)

    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

## ✅ What it does

* Creates a **640×480 window**
* Uses two passes (forward & reverse) over the grid to draw the **mountain-like wireframe**
* Implements the **hidden-surface buffer** (`Z[]`) so nearer points overwrite farther ones
* Produces a **similar mountain ridge pattern** as the QBASIC version

---

## ✅ How to Run

1. Install pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
2. Save the code as `landscape.py`
3. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 landscape.py
   ```
4. You’ll see a **blue mountainous wireframe** similar to the original BASIC effect.

---

Would you like me to:

✅ **Add color gradients** to mimic sunrise/sunset shading?
✅ Or **animate the landscape** by changing the `X2,Y2` viewpoint for a moving “fly-over” effect?
